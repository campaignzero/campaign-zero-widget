# Thank you for Contributing !

We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes. Just follow these requirements for Creating Issues and Pull Requests, and everything will be super simple for everyone :)

## Creating an Issue:

Use the Template that we provide.  Issues reported that do not use the template will be closed.

## Creating a Pull Request:

Before you can submit a PR, you will need to:

1. Clone this repo
2. Make a New Branch ( ideally you will name your branch for the issue you are fixing, e,g, `issue-3-updating-docs` )
3. Commit & Push the New Branch

Now you can submit a new PR using the Template that we provide.  PR's submitted that do not use the template will be closed.
